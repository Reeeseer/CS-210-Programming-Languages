# CS-210-Programming-Languages
Some work from my Programming Languages class

The main focuses of this project are the PythonCode.py and CS210_Starter_CPP_Code.obj. CS210_Starter_CPP_Code.obj was given to me with the 3 functions focused on python integration already made, everything else is my own making. PythonCode.py was given to me 2ith printsomething, PrintMe, and SquareValue function already made for example. The rest of the file was my doing. 

Using these files as a basis I mixed together python and c++ to make a functional menu with functional options. I did well in my use of python to for data organization and preparation. Although i do believe i could have made the menus far more user friendly with better formatting when ilook back at the finished project. The hardest part of the whole project was putting the python and start C++ files in the right directory for the porject to function. I spent an hour before writing any of my own code just getting the program to read the files. My abilities to mix python's data reading capibilities with c++ versitility is a great take away from this project.
